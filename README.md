#### Video Transcript:
* To test the Notepad application, I created a Unit Test Project (.NET Framework) (Contains MS Unit tests) by setting my Targeting .NET Framework version to 4.8.
* FlaUI.Core, FlaUI.UIA2, and FlaUI.UIA3 NuGet packages are installed into my project from Nuget package manager.
* In my test method, Initial SetUp was Fetching data from my configFile.json. It contains the source and destination file paths.
* With the help of a Helper method the object with source file and destination file is fetched. If any error occurs like improper JSON format or invalid File paths, it will throw an exception.
* Then I created a new instance of the Application class and Opened Notepad application.
* An UIA3Automation object is created with that we access the DeskTop and it's Child Elements of it, We can Fetch and Interact with these elements.
* Notepad is our process opened here and its wrapped inside the Application class and stored in our variable "application".
* Condition Factory is used for Filtering the elements.
* While initializing the condition factory it akes an UIA3 Property library which has the info of the proprtys of a Element.
* a Button element hs it's respective name and automation ID and Control type will be button. those are it's properties.
* To get the Main window of the Notepad application. I used the GetWindow method which takes the automation object as the parameter.
* FlaUInspect tool to inspect the Notepad application and find the details of the elements I need to interact with in this approach.
* Here FindFirstDescendant method is Used to find any Elements. To reduce the search time, I used the AutomationId property to find the File menu.
* From the Menu, I clicked on the Open menu item. I used the FindFirstDescendant method to find the Open menu item and click on it.

#### Cases Tested:
* Is the path of the Source file and Destination file specified in config file is correct?
* Is the Choose File window opened after the Open menu item is clicked?
* Is the Choose File window opened after the CTRL+S is clicked?
* Is the Destination File Created after saving?
* Is the Content in destination file is same as the content in Source file?
// Add cases here

    * What are Windows Applications?
    * Why UI Automation Testing?
    * Testing Windows Applications using FlaUI

    * Blockers
 
## What are Windows Applications?
 * Applications that run natively on Microsoft Windows OS are called Windows application.
 * Running natively means those apps can dierectly use the Windows OS's API and Runtime enviroinment no translator or emulator or middleware required.
 * These are coded with windows specific framework (like Win32, .NET, WPF) by following Windows UX guidelines.
 * Some examples: Notepad.exe, Visual Studio, Calculator and File Explorer.

## Why UI Automation Testing?
* To test the app's User Interface we'll be performing UI Automation testing.
* The testing conducted here is Functional UI automation testing because a specific feature's behaviour is tested through the UI and It's automated.
* By Automating testing we can save time, cost and the tests for the application can be used for a long time.
* Tools Available for Windows automation
  
1)UFT 2) TestComplete 3)Coded UI 4) Ranorex 5) White 6) FLaUI

## Testing Windows applications using FlaUI
* FlaUI is based on native UI Automation libraries from Microsoft and therefore kind of a wrapper around them.
* The above statement means the UI Automation Libraries already has methods to access any UI elements of a application but those are low-level and confusing. The FlaUI libraries wraps around those libraries.
* The methods in FlaUI libraries provides more clarity and reduces the number of lines to code for accessing an element.
### FlaUI Inspect:
* It is an GUI Inspection tool.
* #### GUI Inspecting Tools:
  * These tools fetches the data of the UI elements used in an application.
  * Available Inspection Tools : 1) UISPY 2) INSPECT 3) Visual UIA Verify 4) FLAUINSPECT
* FlaUI Modes and Working Screen Shots :

### FlaUI Libraries: 
   * FlaUI Core.
   * FlaUI UIA2.
   * FlaUI UIA3.

### Methods Provided:
* Launch(), Attach(), Close().
* For finding elements: FindFirstDescendant(), FindAllDescendants(), FinfFirstChild, FindAllChildren(), FindFirst(), FindFirstXpath(), FindAllXPath().
* For performing Operations: Click(), Press(), Type(); 

### Optimization Tips for Searching:
* Caching the panel to acces all it's elements.
* Prefer searching using AutomationID.
* Multiple Conditonal factory Conditions chained.
* Speed (varies based on circumstance): FindFirstChild() > FindFirstDescendant() > FindAllChildren() > FindAllDescendants().

### Blockers:
* Suitable DotNet version that FlaUI packages support.
* In windows 11 testing Notepad is not possible. because Notepad is a WindowsAppX/UWP App.
